This code accompanies !['Corruption Drives the Emergence of Civil Society' by Abdullah et al (2013)](http://rsif.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/11/93/20131044.abstract). 

The code estimates the transition matrix between strategies (described in the paper) playing a public goods game from which the stationary distribution is calculated using the power iteration method. Finally a phase diagram is plotted as a function of B (or any other arbitrary parameter).

The method is based on 'Social Learning promotes Institutions for Governing the Commons' Sigmund et al, Nature 2010.
