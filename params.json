Finally a phase diagram is plotted as a function of B (or any other arbitrary parameter).\r\n\r\nThe method is based on 'Social Learning promotes Institutions for Governing the Commons' Sigmund et al, Nature 2010.\r\n\r\n**Dependencies**\r\n\r\nRequires NumPy, SciPy and Matplotlib\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
